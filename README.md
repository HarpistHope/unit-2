Activity 5 Complete - 02/15/2026 - H. McBride

This map currently shows the annual number of visits from U.S. tourists (defined as 'Overnight Stays') in all 47 prefectures of Japan from 2015 to 2024.
At the end of this project, I hope to produce a map which can aid analysis of tourist/travel trends over the last decade by comparing/contrasting high and low traveled areas across Japan.
