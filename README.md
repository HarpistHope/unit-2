This map currently shows the annual number of visits from U.S. tourists (defined as 'Overnight Stays') in all 47 prefectures of Japan from 2015 to 2024.
At the end of this project, I hope to produce a map which can aid analysis of tourist/travel trends over the last decade by comparing/contrasting high and low traveled areas across Japan.

I changed my dataset to more accurately show city-level data. Now the map shows the annual number of airplane passengers (measured by 'enplanements') in 20 major U.S. cities from 2013 until 2023 (some cities combined numbers from multiple airports). It is especially interesting to see the dip in passenger numbers in 2020. 

 For Acitivty 6, I played around a bit with popup styles. For Lab 1, I will change the overall map style and likely trim down to 15 cities to avoid overlapping features.
